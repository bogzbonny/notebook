   - maybe use: https://github.com/skim-rs/skim
   - picture the person in the corner scribbling in a notebook at the rave
   - abstract out the file system logic such that other applications can 
     use it as a backend without having to install notebook itself
   - integrate in bat for the mini TUI 
   - similar: (i just searched "file tag" on crates ... wow 11 projects)

     - https://crates.io/crates/xtagger
       - xtagger is a console application that lets you manage and find tags on
         your files. While similar applications like TMSU and Tagsistant use
         databases to manage the file/tag relationships, others like TagSpaces
         use sidecar files or encode tags in the filename. xtagger is different
         in that it uses the extended attributes of supporting file systems on
         Linux and macOS.
